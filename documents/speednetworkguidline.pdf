Connect with Purpose in Just 60 Minutes
For startups & small businesses
Meet Alex
Alex just launched a tech consulting startup. Excited but overwhelmed, she quickly ran into challenges:

- Limited time: Running a business meant no time for endless coffee meetings.
- Limited budget: Traditional networking meant travel, hotel, and pricey event tickets.
- Limited connections: Building a client base without a network felt impossible.

Alex knew networking was key to growth — but the process was slow, draining, and anxiety-inducing. She didn’t need more contacts… she needed the right ones.

The Step-by-Step Guide: How to Win at Speed Networking
Step 1: Prepare with Purpose
•	Define your goal — Clients? Mentors? Investors?
•	Create a 30-second pitch
•	Practice clear, confident delivery
•	Be ready to take a couple of notes
Step 2: Introduce with Intention
•	Start with a hook: “I help [target audience] achieve [outcome] through [solution].”
•	Be warm, concise, and memorable
•	Let your personality show — connection over perfection
Step 3: Ask Powerful Questions
•	What kind of connections are you looking for?
•	What’s your biggest challenge right now?
•	Who would be a game-changing connection for you?
•	Not everyone can help directly — but they may know someone who can.
Step 4: Be Fully Present
•	Focus on the person, not your pitch
•	Make eye contact, nod, smile
•	Don’t take notes during the session (Speed NetworkNow sends you the contact info afterwards)
Step 5: Follow Up Like a Pro
•	Reach out within 24–48 hours
•	Reference your conversation: “It was great hearing about your new product launch…”
•	Connect on LinkedIn or via email
•	Invite a next step: “Would love to explore synergies.”
3-Minute Speed Pitch Formula (+ Examples)
Nail your introduction with clarity and confidence — even under pressure.

🎯 Formula:

3. What you're looking for
Example:
“Hi, I’m [Name], founder of [Startup Name], a platform that helps small creative agencies streamline client approvals in half the time. We’re currently looking for agency owners and marketing consultants interested in faster workflows and potential partnership opportunities.”
Real-Life Variations
